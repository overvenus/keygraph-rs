## Introduction

This is a convenience library which stores adjacency graphs for physical keyboards. This can be used for looking at physical patterns on numerous keyboards for tools such as password crackers/analysis tools or potentially to help generate suggested corrections for incorrect user input.

I'm currently implementing this library to aid in my fork of zxcvbn.

## Roadmap

* Comprehensive tests
* More keyboards (Qwerty UK etc.)
* Examples
* Determine most likely keyboard from locale
* Expansion to non-printable keys? 
* Spacebar
